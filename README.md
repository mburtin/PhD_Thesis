# PhD Thesis - Michael BURTIN - 2024/2027

This repository contains the materials, data, and documents related to my PhD thesis, conducted as part of the JCJC ANR project "CAPOIERA". The thesis focused on: **_"Cerebral Antibiotic PBPK/PD Optimization and Evaluation of Innovative Regimens against Antibioresistance in ICU patients with cerebral infections"_**

## Thesis & Project Context

Nosocomial cerebro-meningeal infections, such as ventriculitis or meningitis, are serious infections mostly caused by bacteria and often responsible for severe neurological damages, with a high mortality rate (â‰ˆ30%). However, reaching appropriate concentrations in central nervous system (CNS) remains challenging especially because of barriers (blood-brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) turnover. In addition, nosocomial cerebro-meningeal infections are increasingly caused by resistant bacteria, which becomes extremely problematic for clinicians, since most antibiotics do not have an appropriate microbiological spectrum to treat these infections.

An innovative physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) modelling approach linking CNS concentrations of antibiotics with different physicochemical properties to their antimicrobial effect from in vitro hollow-fiber data will be used to optimize the treatment of nosocomial CNS infections in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. In the longer term, this approach could be used to perform therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to ensure adequate antibiotic concentrations are delivered to the CNS.

This project can be subdivided into two parts:

- The experimental part will involve reproducing in an in vitro hollow-fiber infection model (HFIM) the antibiotic concentrations observed in the CSF of patients and evaluating the efficacy of selected antibiotics after administration of different dosing regimens. We will also characterize the potential emergence of bacterial resistance.

- In the second part of the project, we will focus on the development of a PBPK/PD model based on the data collected by HFIM. This model will also be used to simulate the antimicrobial effect at the infection site for alternative dosing regimens. Experimental confirmation by HFIM will be carried out on the most promising dosing regimen. Secondly, data from the characterisation of possible bacterial resistance mechanisms will be implemented in the model as covariates to estimate their impact on antibiotic efficacy, bacterial growth, and so forth.
